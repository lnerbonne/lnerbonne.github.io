Excited to publish the results of my Alabama Gerrymandering analysis! The new population difference metric did a pretty good job at benchmarking gerrymandering - check out the final product down below!

I was really intruiged by the full circle completion of my first round of this pre-planning-execution-results cycle. I especially found it useful to force myself to interrogate the metadata of the datasources I was using; too often I assume I know what's in a file and don't take the time to ensure that I understand it well. 

I'm excited to get to work on my next project- a clustering and demographics analysis reproduction from a study on county-level Covid 19 data from August of 2020.
