As a researcher it's sometimes interesting to step back and ask myself "how did I get to this place in my project?". Oftentimes in the middle of the research process I can give you a general idea- first I tried x, then I pivoted to y, and now I'm working on z ect. Whatever path I've taken through the research process oftentimes feels like it makes perfect sense to me, even if I can barely tell you why I decided to head down each road in the first place. 

This process was tested this week as I set out to write my pre-research plan for an analysis of congressional gerrymandering in Alabama
