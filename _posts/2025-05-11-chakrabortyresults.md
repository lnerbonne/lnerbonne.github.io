For my next project for OpenGIScience, I undertook a partial reproduction of Jayajit Chakraborty's 2021 study `Social inequities in the distribution of COVID-19: An intra-categorical analysis of people with disabilities in the U.S.`, which sought to investigation the connection between Covid 19 Incidence rate on the county level and the prevalence by a variety of demographic subgroups. The author was specifically interested in the correlation between disability rate and Covid cases, something that would be interesting for both public health officials and policymakers. 

This project gave me the opportunity to dive into the nuts and bolts of epidemiological clustering functions through the author's choice of using clusters of high incidence counties as a spatial control, with interesting results that I'm still working through. 

If you want to check out the project results they're here: [https://lnerbonne/Covid_19_Clustering_Original/blob/main/docs/report/Final_Analysis_and_Report.html](https://github.com/lnerbonne/Covid_19_Clustering_Original/Final_Analysis_and_Report.html)
